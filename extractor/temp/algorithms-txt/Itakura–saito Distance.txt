The distance is defined as:[2]
The Itakura–Saito distance is a Bregman divergence, but is not a true metric since it is not symmetric[3] and it does not fulfil triangle inequality.
In Non-negative matrix factorization the Itakura-Saito divergence can be used as a measure of the quality of the factorization: this implies a meaningful statistical model of the components and can be solved through an iterative method.[4]
