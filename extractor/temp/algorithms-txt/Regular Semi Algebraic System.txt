In computer algebra, a regular semi-algebraic system is a particular kind of triangular system of multivariate polynomials over a real closed field.


Regular chains and triangular decompositions are fundamental and well-developed tools for describing the complex solutions of polynomial systems. The notion of a regular semi-algebraic system is an adaptation of the concept of a regular chain focusing on solutions of the real analogue: semi-algebraic systems.
Any semi-algebraic system 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 can be decomposed into finitely many regular semi-algebraic systems 




S

1


,
…
,

S

e




{\displaystyle S_{1},\ldots ,S_{e}}

 such that a point (with real coordinates) is a solution of 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 if and only if it is a solution of one of the systems 




S

{\displaystyle S_{1},\ldots ,S_{e}}

Let 



T


{\displaystyle T}

 be a regular chain of 





k


[

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}

 for some ordering of the variables 




x

=

…

x

n




{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}

 and a real closed field 





k




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }}

. Let 




u

=

u

…

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =u_{1},\ldots ,u_{d}}

 and 




y

d




{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} =y_{1},\ldots ,y_{n-d}}

 designate respectively the variables of 




x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }

 that are free and algebraic with respect to 



T


{\displaystyle T}

. Let 



P
⊂


k


[

x

]


{\displaystyle P\subset {\mathbf {k} }[\mathbf {x} ]}

 be finite such that each polynomial in 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 is regular w.r.t.\ the saturated ideal of 



T


{\displaystyle T}

. Define 




P

:=
{
p

p

P
}


{\displaystyle P_{>}:=\{p>0\mid p\in P\}}

. Let 





Q




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {Q}}}

 be a quantifier-free formula of 





k


[

x

]


{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }[\mathbf {x} ]}

 involving only the variables of 




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }

. We say that

{\displaystyle R:=[{\mathcal {Q}},T,P_{>}]}

The zero set of

, denoted by

{\displaystyle {Z}_{\mathbf {k} }(R)}

{\displaystyle (u,y)\in {\mathbf {k} }^{d}\times {\mathbf {k} }^{n-d}}

 such that

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {Q}}(u)}

 is true and 



t

{\displaystyle t(u,y)=0}
