MD decimation / interpolation filters derived from 1-D filters and maximally decimated filter banks are widely used and constitute important steps in the design of multidimensional multirate systems.


Decimation and interpolation are necessary steps to create multidimensional multirate systems. In the one dimensional system, decimation and interpolation can be seen in the figure.
Theoretically, explanations of decimation and interpolation are:[1]
• Decimation (Down-sampling):
The M times decimated version of x(n) is defined as y(n)= x(Mn), where M is a nonsingular integer matrix called decimation matrix.
In the frequency domain, relation becomes
where
Above expression changes in multidimensional case, In 2-D case M matrix becomes 2x2 and the region becomes parallel-ogram which is defined as:

{\displaystyle [-\pi ,\pi )}


• Expansion (Up-sampling):
The L times up sampled version of x(n) defined as Y(n)= x(L−1 . n), where n is in the range of lattice generated by L which is L*m. The matrix L is called expansion matrix.
In the one dimensional systems, the decimator term is used for decimation filter and expander term is used for interpolation filter. The decimator filters generally have the range of [-π / M, π / M], where M is decimation matrix. In the multidimensional decimation and expansion, the passband changes to:
where x in the range of [-1, 1)D [1]
When M matrix is not diagonal, the filters are not separable. The complexity of non-separable filters increase with increasing number of dimension. Design procedure and example:[1]
In detail, By using prototype filter

, MD multirate filter can be defined as;
for k=D-1, where D represents number of dimensions:
This is separable low pass filter and its impulse response will be;
where k=D-1, where D represents number of dimensions:

{\displaystyle h_{s}(n)=p(n_{0})\cdot p(n_{1})\dots p(n_{k})=\prod _{i=0}^{k}{\frac {sin{\frac {\pi \cdot n_{i}}{J(M)}}}{(\pi \cdot n_{i})}}}


Now, considering

This process basically shows how to derive MD multirate filter from 1-D filter.
When the number of channel is equal to J(M), this is called a maximally decimated filter bank. To analyze filter banks, polyphase decomposition is used.

{\displaystyle r_{i}(n)=x(Mn-k_{i})}


Where ki can takes the values of k0,k1,…kJ(M)-1. In the z domain,

{\displaystyle X(z)}
