FULL TEXT
Blum Blum Shub (B.B.S.) is a pseudorandom number generator proposed in 1986 by Lenore Blum, Manuel Blum and Michael Shub[1] that is derived from Michael O. Rabin's oblivious transfer mapping.
Blum Blum Shub takes the form
where M = pq is the product of two large primes p and q. At each step of the algorithm, some output is derived from xn+1; the output is commonly either the bit parity of xn+1 or one or more of the least significant bits of xn+1.
The seed x0 should be an integer that is co-prime to M (i.e. p and q are not factors of x0) and not 1 or 0.
The two primes, p and q, should both be congruent to 3 (mod 4) (this guarantees that each quadratic residue has one square root which is also a quadratic residue) and gcd(φ(p − 1), φ(q − 1)) should be small (this makes the cycle length large).
An interesting characteristic of the Blum Blum Shub generator is the possibility to calculate any xi value directly (via Euler's theorem):
where 



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }

 is the Carmichael function. (Here we have 



λ

(

{\displaystyle \lambda (M)=\lambda (p\cdot q)=\operatorname {lcm} (p-1,q-1)}

).


There is a proof reducing its security to the computational difficulty of solving the quadratic residuosity problem.[1] When the primes are chosen appropriately, and O(log log M) lower-order bits of each xn are output, then in the limit as M grows large, distinguishing the output bits from random should be at least as difficult as solving the Quadratic residuosity problem modulo M.
Let

11


{\displaystyle p=11}

, 



q
=
19


{\displaystyle q=19}

 and 



s
=
3


{\displaystyle s=3}

 (where 



s


{\displaystyle s}

 is the seed). We can expect to get a large cycle length for those small numbers, because
