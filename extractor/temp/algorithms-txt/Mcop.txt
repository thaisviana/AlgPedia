FULL TEXT
Multi-Constrained Optimal Path Selection or MCOP is a network path selection problem.
H_MCOP was designed to offer a (non-optimal) solution to the RSP and MCP problems which are otherwise NP-complete for an optimal solution algorithm. H_MCOP defining feature is that it uses heuristics to short-cut some of the complexity.
